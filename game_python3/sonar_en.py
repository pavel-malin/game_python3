You are the captain of the Simon, a treasure-hunting ship. Your current mission
is to use sonar devices to find three sunken treasure chests at the bottom of
the ocean. But you only have cheap sonar that finds distance, not direction.

Enter the coordinates to drop a sonar device. The ocean map will be marked with
how far away the nearest chest is, or an X if it is beyond the sonar device's
range. For example, the C marks are where chests are. The sonar device shows a
3 because the closest chest is 3 spaces away.
